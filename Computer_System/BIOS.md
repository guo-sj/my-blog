## What is BIOS

BIOS stands for **Basic Input/Output System**, the BIOS (pronounced bye-oss) is a ROM chip 
found on motherboards that allows you to access and set up your computer system at the 
most basic level. 


## What are the four main functions of a PC BIOS

1. POST - Test the computer hardware and make sure no errors exist before loading the operating 
system. Additional information on the POST is available on our POST and beep codes page.

2. Bootstrap Loader - Locate the operating system. If a capable operating system is located, 
the BIOS will pass control to it.

3. BIOS drivers - Low-level drivers that give the computer basic operational control over your 
computer's hardware.

4. BIOS setup or CMOS setup - Configuration program that allows you to configure hardware settings 
including system settings, such as date, time, and computer passwords.

BIOS 具有**定位操作系统**的功能，这也是用U盘装系统时需要在 BIOS 中设置 OS 启动位置的原因。

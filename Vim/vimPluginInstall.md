# Vim Plugin Install

## Question
How to install a vim plugin in windows platform and linux platform?

## Answer
To install a vim plugin, you need just a `plugin manager` and the `plugins` you want to install.

### Linux platform

#### Plugin manager
There are many vim plugin managers, and here `vim-pathogen` is preferred. To install `vim-pathogen` , first
make sure you have `.vim/autoload and .vim/bundle` directories, if not, using the following command to create:
```
mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle
```

Then use *curl* command to get `vim-pathogen`:
```
curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim
```

Another way to get `vim-pathogen` is using *git clone*:
```
git clone https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen && cp ./vim-pathogen/autoload/pathogen.vim ~/.vim/autoload
```

And add these statements to your `.vimrc` file:
```
execute pathogen#infect()
syntax on
filetype plugin indent on
```

#### Install plugin
When you've got `vim-pathogen`, install plugin becomes very easy. Here, we want to install some pretty useful plugins:

- Nerdtree: `cd ~/.vim/bundle && git clone git@github.com:guo-mantou/nerdtree`
- Syntax-Sensible: `cd ~/.vim/bundle && git clone git@github.com:guo-mantou/vim-sensible.git`
- vim-barbaric: `cd ~/.vim/bundle && git clone git@github.com:guo-mantou/vim-barbaric`

### Windows platform

In windows platform, install vim plugin become more simple. Open your windows terminal (wsl) and type:
```
mkdir -p ~/vimfiles/pack/vendor/start

cd ~/vimfiles/pack/vendor/start && git clone https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree
```

That's all!
